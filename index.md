title: GTFOBins
---

GTFOBins is a curated list of Unix binaries that can be exploited by an attacker to bypass local security restrictions.

This was inspired by the [LOLBins and LOLScripts](https://github.com/api0cradle/LOLBAS) project for Windows environment.

The project collects legitimate Unix binaries that can be abused to <strike>get the f**k</strike> break out restricted shells, escalate or maintain elevated privileges, download or exfiltrate files, and facilitate the other post-exploitation tasks outlined [here](/functions/).

GTFOBins aims to be a shared project where everyone can contribute with additional binaries and techniques. You can find detailed instructions [here](/contribute/).
