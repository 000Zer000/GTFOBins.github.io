GTFOBins is a curated list of Unix binaries that can be exploited by an attacker to bypass local security restrictions.

The project collects legitimate Unix binaries that can be abused to ~~get the f**k~~ break out restricted shells, escalate or maintain elevated privileges, transfer files, spawn bind and reverse shells, and facilitate the other post-exploitation tasks. See the full list of [functions].

This was inspired by the [LOLBins] project for Windows.

GTFOBins is a [collaborative] project where everyone can [contribute] with additional binaries and techniques.
